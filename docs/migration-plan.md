# Migration Plan

1. Identify bounded contexts and extract services
2. Set up EKS and supporting infrastructure
3. Containerize and deploy each service
4. Implement CI/CD pipelines
5. Migrate data incrementally
6. Maintain backward API compatibility
7. Monitor, test, and cut over traffic
8. Rollback procedures in place

# Migration Plan (Expanded)

- Use API gateway to route traffic to monolith and new services during migration
- Implement feature flags for gradual cutover
- Use database replication or change data capture for data migration
- Monitor error rates and rollback if needed
- Communicate changes to stakeholders and provide training
